# Optimizing SQL Server Performance for Financial Transaction

# Case Study: Calculating Year-to-Date and Lifetime Spending

# Introduction
This case study demonstrates how to optimize SQL Server queries for financial transaction data, focusing on calculating Year-to-Date (YTD) and Lifetime spending. We'll explore various techniques, including indexing, partitioning, pre-calculation, and parallel execution, to significantly improve query performance.

# Problem Statement
We have a large table, VietinBankTransactions, containing millions of financial transaction records. The goal is to efficiently calculate:

Year-to-Date (YTD) Spend: The total spending within a specified year (e.g., 2025).

Lifetime Spend: The total spending across all years.

The original query was slow and inefficient, requiring a full table scan.

# Solution: Optimized Query Strategies
We will systematically apply and compare the following optimization strategies:

1. Baseline: No Optimization
2. Indexing on TransactionDate and CreatedBy
3. Partitioning on TransactionDate
4. Pre-Calculation of Daily Aggregates
5. Parallel Execution (MAXDOP)

# Demo
## 1. Seed data
First, we create and populate the XBankTransactions table.

```
CREATE TABLE XBankTransactions (
  	TransactionID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
	Branch VARCHAR(20),
	AccountNumber VARCHAR(20),
	TransactionDate DATETIME,
	TransactionType VARCHAR(10),
	Amount DECIMAL(18,2),
	Currency CHAR(3),
	Description VARCHAR(255),
	CreatedBy VARCHAR(50),
	CreatedDate DATETIME,
	UpdatedBy VARCHAR(50) NULL,
	UpdatedDate DATETIME NULL
);
```

```
-- Replace 'C:\path\your\seed_data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file
BULK INSERT XBankTransactions
FROM 'C:\path\your\seed_data.csv'
WITH (
    FORMAT='CSV',
    FIRSTROW=2,
    FIELDTERMINATOR=',',
    ROWTERMINATOR='\n',
    TABLOCK
);
```

## 2. Query Analysis and Optimization
We'll analyze the performance of the following query:

```
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;
SELECT
    t.CreatedBy,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN t.TransactionDate >= '2025-01-01' AND t.TransactionDate <= '2025-12-31'
        THEN t.Amount ELSE 0
    END) AS YearToDateSpend,
    SUM(t.Amount) AS LifetimeSpend
FROM XBankTransactions AS t
WHERE t.TransactionDate <= '2025-12-31'
GROUP BY t.CreatedBy
ORDER BY YearToDateSpend DESC;
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;
SET STATISTICS IO OFF;
```

### 2.1 Baseline: Query Without Any Optimization (Plain Table Scan)
This approach queries the entire VietinBankTransactions table without any partitioning or indexing.

```
SELECT
    t.CreatedBy,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN t.TransactionDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
        THEN t.Amount ELSE 0
    END) AS YearToDateSpend,
    SUM(t.Amount) AS LifetimeSpend
FROM XBankTransactions AS t
WHERE t.TransactionDate <= '2025-12-31'
GROUP BY t.CreatedBy
ORDER BY YearToDateSpend DESC;
```

| Metric             | Value     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Execution Time     | 37s       |
| IO Reads           | High      |
| Partition Pruning  | ‚ùå No     |
| Index Usage        | ‚ùå No     |

üö® Issues:
Full table scan (expensive).
Poor query performance due to lack of indexes or partitioning.

## 2.2 Applying Indexing on TransactionDate and CreatedBy
Adding an index can significantly improve filtering and aggregation performance.

```
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_TransactionDate_CreatedBy
ON XBankTransactions (TransactionDate, CreatedBy)
INCLUDE (Amount);
```

Execution Results: <image_here>

| Metric             | Value      |
|--------------------|------------|
| Execution Time     | 25s        |
| IO Reads           | Reduced       |
| Partition Pruning  | ‚ùå No      |
| Index Usage        | ‚úÖ Yes     |


‚úÖ Improvements: Better filtering & grouping performance due to indexing.
Reduced IO reads, but still scans the whole table.

## 2.3 Applying Partitioning on TransactionDate
Partitioning helps query only relevant data instead of scanning the entire table.

Partition Function & Scheme:
```
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION pf_TransactionDate(datetime)  
AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES ('2023-01-01', '2024-01-01', '2025-01-01');
```
```
CREATE PARTITION SCHEME ps_TransactionDate  
AS PARTITION pf_TransactionDate ALL TO ([PRIMARY]);
```

Partitioned Table Creation:
```
CREATE TABLE XBankTransactions_Partitioned (
    TransactionID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,
    CreatedBy VARCHAR(50),
    TransactionDate DATETIME,
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2)
) ON ps_TransactionDate(TransactionDate);
```

Execution Results: <image_here>

| Metric             | Value      |
|--------------------|------------|
| Execution Time     | 18s        |
| IO Reads           | Low       |
| Partition Pruning  | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Index Usage        | ‚úÖ Yes     |

‚úÖ Improvements:

Queries target specific partitions instead of the whole table.
Lower execution time by reducing scanned data.

## 2.4 Pre-Calculating Daily Aggregates (Materialized View)
Instead of computing totals dynamically, we pre-calculate daily sums and store them in a summary table.

Daily Summary Table:
```
CREATE TABLE DailyTransactionSummary (
    CreatedBy VARCHAR(50),
    TransactionDate DATE,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(18,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (CreatedBy, TransactionDate)
);
```

Pre-aggregation Query (Scheduled Job):
```
INSERT INTO DailyTransactionSummary (CreatedBy, TransactionDate, TotalAmount)
SELECT CreatedBy, CAST(TransactionDate AS DATE), SUM(Amount)
FROM XBankTransactions
GROUP BY CreatedBy, CAST(TransactionDate AS DATE);
```

Optimized Query Using Pre-aggregated Data:
```
SELECT 
    CreatedBy, 
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN TransactionDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31' 
        THEN TotalAmount ELSE 0 
    END) AS YearToDateSpend,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS LifetimeSpend
FROM DailyTransactionSummary
WHERE TransactionDate <= '2025-12-31' 
GROUP BY CreatedBy;
```

Execution Results: <image_here>
| Metric             | Value      |
|--------------------|------------|
| Execution Time     | 5s        |
| IO Reads           | Very Low       |
| Partition Pruning  | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Index Usage        | ‚úÖ Yes     |

‚úÖ Improvements:

Extreme performance boost (pre-calculated data).
Minimal computation during queries.

## 2.5 Enabling Parallel Execution (MAXDOP)
Using parallel execution allows SQL Server to process data in multiple threads.

Query with MAXDOP:
```
SELECT 
    CreatedBy, 
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN TransactionDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31' 
        THEN TotalAmount ELSE 0 
    END) AS YearToDateSpend,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS LifetimeSpend
FROM DailyTransactionSummary
WHERE TransactionDate <= '2025-12-31' 
GROUP BY CreatedBy
OPTION (MAXDOP 8);  -- Allow up to 8 parallel threads
```

Execution Results: <image_here>
| Metric             | Value      |
|--------------------|------------|
| Execution Time     | 2s       |
| IO Reads           | Minimal       |
| Partition Pruning  | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Index Usage        | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Parallel Processing        | ‚úÖ Yes     |

‚úÖ Improvements: Uses multiple CPU cores for even faster execution.
Further reduction in execution time compared to pre-aggregation alone.

| Pre-calculation + MAXDOP       | 2s             | Minimal     | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes             |

üìå Conclusion

By applying these optimizations, we reduced the query execution time from 37 seconds to 2 seconds. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of indexing, partitioning, pre-calculation, and parallel execution in optimizing SQL Server queries for large financial datasets.
